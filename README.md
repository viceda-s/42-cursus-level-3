# Milestone 3 – In Progress ⏳

Welcome to my repository documenting **Milestone 3** at 42 School. This repository tracks my ongoing progress on both core projects—**Philosophers** and **Minishell**—including technical highlights, structures, and implementation insights.

## 🏅 My Scores

| Project | Status | Focus \& Technical Highlights |
| :-- | :--: | :-- |
| Philosophers | ✅ 100/100 | Concurrent programming, thread/mutex synchronization |
| Minishell | ⏳ In Progress | Shell parsing, process management, Unix signals |

## 🔎 Project Details

### 🍝 Philosophers – 100/100 ✅

- **Objective:**
Implement and simulate the classic Dining Philosophers problem to explore concurrency, synchronization, and deadlock avoidance.
- **Key Features:**
    - Efficient thread handling with **POSIX threads**.
    - Mutexes for fork management to prevent data races.
    - Deadlock detection strategies and starvation prevention.
    - Responsive logging and timing to track philosopher actions.
- **Skills gained:** Concurrency, multithreading, resource locking, timing coordination, edge-case testing.


### 🐚 Minishell - ⏳ In Progress

- **Objective:**
Recreate a simple Unix shell capable of interpreting and executing user commands.
- **Key Features (planned):**
    - Custom parser for handling complex command lines, quoting, and variable expansion.
    - Process forking and execution with robust error management.
    - Implementation of pipelines (`|`), redirections (`>`, `<`), and built-in commands.
    - Signal handling (SIGINT/SIGQUIT) for user interaction fidelity.
- **Anticipated Skills:** Parsing, process and memory management, file descriptor manipulation, shell scripting standards.

## 🏆 Personal Highlights

- Tackling real concurrent systems and Unix shell internals.
- Applying advanced C coding standards and debugging multi-process environments.
- Incrementally building resilient code with dedicated testing for corner cases.


## 🚀 How to Explore
